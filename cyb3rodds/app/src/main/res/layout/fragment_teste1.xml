 Usually the odds are in favor of the team who is most likely to win, lets say team A has 1,05 odd and on the other hand
team B has a 6,30 odd, it's most likely that team A will win
the game because their the strongest team, the minor the odd
the better the team is statistically, and less money you
receive from betting and winning on the team.
